#Enter data into this file and run the "update_hall_overviews.py" script to insert dining hall overviews into the database
#Data in this file is stored in this format:
####################################################################
#name|description|location|hours|accepts mealswipes|mealswipe hours#
####################################################################
#One dining location per line
#Hours are in a very specific format: days (integers, where 0 = Monday and 6 = Sunday) or ranges of days (0-4 == "Monday" - "Friday") followed by a colon with their hours (0-4:10-22 == "Monday through Friday, 10 AM - 10 PM", -1 indicates that the location is not open in the given period) are provided in a comma-separated list. Note on hours: Minutes, when present, are given after a decimal point: 0-4:10.30-22
#0-4:10-22,5-6:13-16
#"Accepts Mealswipes" is a numeric field. 0 indictes no mealswipes are accepted, 1 indicates they are accepted whenever open (dining halls, essentially), and 2 indicates meal swipes are accepted at specified hours
#Mealswipe hours are given in the same format as above hours, only needs to be set if "Accepts Mealswipes" == 2
#To pair dining hall overviews with dining halls, you'll have to cut "Menu" off of the dining hall menu name and check if the menu name is a substring of the hall name
